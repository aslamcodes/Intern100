# Notes
## Testing
### Unit
- Tests every single unit of the program
- It is when you unit test you know that you can move on to next
- It only quickens the project not slowing down
### Three parts of Unit Testing
- Arrange - Get required resources (methods, classes) preping
- Action - Actual calls to the mehtod
- Assert - Test the things
