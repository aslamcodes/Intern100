# Classes
- Classes can contain field, constructor and methods or behaviour
- When objects are instantiated for a class, we only hold the reference to the objects
# Structs
- The main diff btw the classes and structs lies in their value type, they can also have constructor, fields and methods
- Struct is a value type, meaning the copy is passed around instead of a reference
# Records
- Records can also have methods, but you see them mostly with props
- They provide built in functionalities for comparing and hashing
-  By default, everything init will become immutable once object is created
# Abstract Classes
- Indicates that a class is missing components or incomplete implementation?
- Abstract classes act as templates for creating more specific classes. They define a general structure and functionalities (including abstract methods) that concrete subclasses must implement to become usable objects.
