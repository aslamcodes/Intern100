          <h1>MY INTERESTS</h1>
          <h3>Theologies</h3>
          <p>
            I have a passion for learning about the different theologies of the
            world, since we got lot of influence in our day to day life.
          </p>
          <h3>Arabic Language</h3>
          <p>
            I've recently started learning Arabic, and I'm moved by the way it sounds and the way it's written, <strong>especially the Quran</strong>. Learning this language helps in spritual growth and understanding the Quran without translation.
          </p> 
           <h3>Books</h3>
          <p>
            I started reading books other than Quran very recently, and sucessfully made it as a habit, with my first books being <strong>"Sealed Nectar"</strong> and <strong>"Atomic Habits"</strong>.
          </p>
          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p>
            I see any Technology as a solution to a problem. Since I love to solve problems, and since I solve problems mostly using technology, I love technology. and Call it as <strong>My Passion.</strong>

          <h3>Islam</h3>
          <p>
            Islam is the way of Life. It has a huge influence in my life. I do this by following the commandments of Allah(God in Arabic) through Quran and apply the teachings of prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in my day to day life. 
            such as the way of eating, sleeping, talking, walking, and so on.
          </p>
          <h3>Family</h3>
          <p>
            I love to spend time with my family, and I believe that family is the
            most important thing in life. I love to spend time with my sibling and
            parents, and I love to take them out and have fun with them.
          </p>
          <h3>Seeking challenges and solutions</h3>
          <p>
            I love to find problems and solve them, it can be anything from a math problem to a real-life problem. I love to find solutions to problems and I love to help people with their problems.
