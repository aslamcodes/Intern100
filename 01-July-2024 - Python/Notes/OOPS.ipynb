    "# Encapsulating with Classes\n",
    "Classes is the way to encapusulate data and functionality together in python[1], with which we can create instances of that type(class).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes **Multiple Inheritance**, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name\n",
    "\n",
    "## `__new__()` magic method\n",
    "- Classes are callable[2], with which it can produces instances of itself. `__new__()` can be overrided to alter the functionality and then `__init__()` will be called to instantiate the object[3]\n",
    "- `__new__()` will be handling the instance creation process & `__init__()` will be handling the instantiation[4]\n",
    "- `__new()__` is a static method, that belongs to the class, it receives the class `cls` arguement[5]\n",
    "- it can be useful to control the object creation phase, when we would want to create a singleton class\n",
    "\n",
    "> Typical implementations create a new instance of the class by invoking the superclassâ€™s __new__() method using super().__new__(cls[, ...]) with appropriate arguments and then modifying the newly created instance as necessary before returning it.[5]\n",
