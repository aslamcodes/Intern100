# Main file

The main file (usually labelled `main.scss`) should be the only Sass file from the whole code base not to begin with an underscore. This file should not contain anything but `@import` and comments.

_Note: when using [Eyeglass](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass) for distribution, it might be a fine idea to name this file `index.scss` rather than `main.scss` in order to stick to [Eyeglass modules specifications](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass#writing-an-eyeglass-module-with-sass-files). See [#21](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate/issues/21) for reference._
